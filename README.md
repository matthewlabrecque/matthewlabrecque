# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Matthew

I'm a Computational Mathematics/Computer Science student at the [University of New Hampshire](https://ceps.unh.edu/). Currently, I work at the [UNH InterOperability Laboratory](https://www.iol.unh.edu/) on the Open-Source Team where I do development on [DPDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Plane_Development_Kit). My main languages I use are Python, Go, Rust, Java, and C/C++. I also have skills in SQL, CI/CD development, and open-source development.

## Currently, I'm building:
- A script for Arch Linux to enable the quick and easy deployment of a basic Arch system with proper security/firewall configurations in place as well as core programs/utilities.
- A cyberdeck powered by a Raspberry Pi CM5, which I built because I wanted something similar to what Aiden Pearce had in WATCH_DOGS and could be used for security hacking.
- A variation of the auto chess bot coding project for the game Backgammon. I grew up playing Backgammon so I wanted to build a bot for that game instead, while also using it as an opportunity to learn how the Rust langauge works.
