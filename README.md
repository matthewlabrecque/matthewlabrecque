# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Matthew

I'm a Computational Mathematics/Computer Science student at the [University of New Hampshire](https://ceps.unh.edu/). Currently, I work at the [UNH InterOperability Laboratory](https://www.iol.unh.edu/) on the Open-Source Team where I do development on [DPDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Plane_Development_Kit). My main languages I use are Python, Go, Rust, Java, and C/C++. I also have skills in SQL, CI/CD development, and open-source development.

## Currently, I'm building:
- A script for Arch Linux which I built to enable the instant deployment of a basic Arch system with proper security/firewall configurations in place. I used this project as an opportiunity to learn how BASH scripting works in Linux as well as how package managers work.
- This project was inspired by multiple online projects for battery-powered computers, but I wanted to build something similar to what Aiden Pearce had in WATCH_DOGS. The result was a Raspberry Pi CM5 powered computer that has both Wifi and cellular connectivity and can be used for remote security testing.
- A variation of the common autochess bot coding project. I grew up playing backgamming so I wanted to build a bot for that game instead, while also using it as an opportunity to learn how Rust works.
