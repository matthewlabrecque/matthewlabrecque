I'm a Computational Mathematics/Computer Science student at the [University of New Hampshire](https://ceps.unh.edu/).

- I'm currently working on
    - A script for Arch Linux which I built to enable the instant deployment of a basic Arch system with proper security/firewall configurations in place. I used this project as an opportiunity to learn how BASH scripting works in Linux as well as how package managers work.
    - This project was inspired by multiple online projects for battery-powered computers, but I wanted to build something similar to what Aiden Pearce had in WATCH_DOGS. The result was a Raspberry Pi CM5 powered computer that has both Wifi and cellular connectivity and can be used for remote security testing.
    - A variation of the common autochess bot coding project. I grew up playing backgamming so I wanted to build a bot for that game instead, while also using it as an opportunity to learn how Rust works.
