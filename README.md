# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Matthew

I'm a Computational Mathematics/Computer Science student at the [University of New Hampshire](https://ceps.unh.edu/). Currently, I work at the [UNH InterOperability Laboratory](https://www.iol.unh.edu/) on the Open-Source Team where I do development on [DPDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Plane_Development_Kit). My main languages I use are Python, Go, Rust, Java, and C/C++. I also have skills in SQL, CI/CD development, and open-source development.

## Currently, I'm building:
- Playcaller, a simplified configuration management platform built on the Ansible automation tool which allows easy creation and management of autoconfiguration scripts for personal/professional development.
